# Detecting-Seismo-ionospheric-Anomalies-Associated-with-the-2019-Ridgecrest-California-Earthquakes-
The association between earthquakes and ionospheric precursors has been widely reported in previous studies. The Swarm satellite constellation, the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES), and the ground-based global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations provide us new opportunities to detect ionospheric precursors to earthquakes for a better understanding of the seismic-ionospheric coupling. In California, two shallow earthquakes with magnitudes of 6.5 and 7.1, the two higher magnitude events of the Ridgecrest earthquakes sequence, occurred on July 4 and July 6, 2019, respectively. This study adopted total electron content (TEC) data from the GNSS, and electron density (Ne), and electron temperature (Te) data from the CSES and Swarm to study the possible ionospheric perturbations before the Ridgecrest earthquakes.
